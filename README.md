The Patient Management System (PMS) is a structured, web-based application developed using HTML, React.js, and CSS, designed to optimize hospital operations by digitizing patient and staff management processes. With a focus on functional efficiency and modular architecture, the system offers a streamlined approach to handling essential healthcare tasks within a centralized platform.
Key features of the system include a real-time Dashboard for administrative oversight, Patient and Doctor Registration modules to manage individual profiles, and Department Assignment to ensure organized resource allocation. Additionally, Shift Management enables effective staff scheduling, while the Appointments module simplifies the coordination of patient-doctor consultations. The integrated Billing System ensures accurate and transparent financial processing.
Built on a component-based React framework, the PMS ensures ease of maintenance, scalability, and rapid integration of future healthcare services. By eliminating paperwork, reducing manual errors, and enhancing data accessibility, the system represents a significant advancement in hospital administration. It supports the broader vision of a smart, accountable, and patient-centered healthcare environment.
