# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Abstract
The Patient Management System (PMS) is a structured, web-based application developed using HTML, React.js, and CSS, designed to optimize hospital operations by digitizing patient and staff management processes. With a focus on functional efficiency and modular architecture, the system offers a streamlined approach to handling essential healthcare tasks within a centralized platform.
Key features of the system include a real-time Dashboard for administrative oversight, Patient and Doctor Registration modules to manage individual profiles, and Department Assignment to ensure organized resource allocation. Additionally, Shift Management enables effective staff scheduling, while the Appointments module simplifies the coordination of patient-doctor consultations. The integrated Billing System ensures accurate and transparent financial processing.
Built on a component-based React framework, the PMS ensures ease of maintenance, scalability, and rapid integration of future healthcare services. By eliminating paperwork, reducing manual errors, and enhancing data accessibility, the system represents a significant advancement in hospital administration. It supports the broader vision of a smart, accountable, and patient-centered healthcare environment.
